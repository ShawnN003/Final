Tasks:

High Priority: 
    Run a smooth game after high priority is done
    Record the game type? Rock paper scissors or tic-tac-toe


Mid Priority:
    rock paper scissors ejs - I can't quite get everything to stay lined up when the browser is resized. maybe something with the container they're in or the css. 
    home ejs
    functionality of TTT
    right now we are passing username from page to page. maybe we can store it in a global
        variable instead?
    link the home button to games screen instead of log-in. add option to change users on games page.
    check the database for a name before trying to insert it so the dup entries error message doesn't come up.


Low Priority:
    rps text doesn't line up with background when resizing webpage.
    create and "anonymous" user if the name is left blank.
    highscores page doesn't deal with a missing DB
    home links to sign in, but should probably link to games, with an option to change usernames.
    
    ttt ejs
    Gather images
    Add deep styling
    label anything clickable with a class to style on hover
